Communicator (wifi/bluetooth+radiomodule+communication with smartphone and PC)
Hi there. I want to create communicator device with following functionality:
1) Communication between 2 similar devices (sms / voice / data-files transferring)
- by integrated radiomodules (wifi esp32-now)
- by external radiomodules (nrf24l01+)
- by external radiomodules (lora E220)
2) Interaction with smartphones (wifi / bluetooth / USB)
- as external radiomodem (add-on to any smartphone) with full smartphone functionality
- as main device which uses smartphone for input/indication
3) Compass + GPS receiver and tracker 
- get GPS coordinates and heading  and transfer to 2nd devuce or to a group
- estimate range between 2 points (to the other device or inputed coordinates, or base choosen coordinates).
